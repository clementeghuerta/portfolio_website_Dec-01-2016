        I developed the design for the “Beer Shop” App with the thought of having a great user interface that involved a fluid animation path from one point to another. My thought process behind this application was to be in someone’s position who would like to order beer for delivery. I wrote down and planned all of it before starting the design. </b>

    <ol>


    <li><b>My process for this design:</b></li>
      <li><b>Step 1:</b> 
          <p>Step 1: Write down what I wanted from the app.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Step 2:</b><br>
          <p>Write each option for each page down in different sections, which then formed each individual page. </p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Step 3:</b><br>
      <p>Sketch the user interface with the options I had written down and then finalizing each sketch.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Step 4:</b> <br>
      <p>Design with Adobe Illustrator and choosing the best colors, which showed the same branding across as well as a appealing design for beer.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Step 5:</b><br>
      <p>Prototype with inVision.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Step 6:</b><br>
      <p>Re-adjust the design.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>Step 7:</b><br>
      <p>Finalize all of the pages.</p>

          <p>Making a user flow with the main menu buttons. This was very hard because I had never made a user-flow with more than one path. My main obstacle was thinking of more than 5 variables at a time, which led me to design longer than expected before concentrating on a clean user interface.</p>

  			   <h1 class="h2">About</h1>
            
        Hello, I am a designer based in the Silicon Valey. <br><br>

        Looking back at what made me want to become a designer, I remember that when I was a teenager I started to fall in love with art and many mediums within it. Illustration exponentially took over the time in which I created other art and did anything else for that matter. After high school, I attended Academy of Art University to concentrate in 2D and 3D illustration. I enjoyed it very much, for it was an extremely fun time as I learned many valuable skills such as how to storyboard an animation, and I even directed a group of students for a short story animation. <br><br>

        I believe that because I grew up with other great inspirations like Apple and later Facebook,  this led me to follow my passion in graphic and web design. <br><br>

         And as I read more and more on web design and the many great job opportunities available such as User Interface designer, Visual Designer, and Product Designer, I have made it a goal to focus my skills in user interface design, responsive web design, and product design. Currently, I am a Senior at California State University East Bay as a graphic designer. <br><br>

        I have worked as a front-end developer, vector re-touch artist and illustrator. I believe that my strongest strength is planning out my designs, having great visual, written, and verbal communication skills, and working well within a team as well as with minimal to no direction.
